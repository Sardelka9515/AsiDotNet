Write an asi mod... in C# !

[Topic on gtaforums](https://gtaforums.com/topic/987273-write-an-asi-mod-in-c/)

A post-build action has been setup to publish natively compiled dll to **bin** folder, rename it to *.asi and put into GTAV directory( or create a symlink, whatever.).
Ta-da! you have an asi mod written in C#~~
